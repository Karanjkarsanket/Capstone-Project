# Capstone-Project
This is Capstone project done on Food Delivery prediction 
The “Food Delivery Company” is a delivery company that delivers Italian, Thai, Indian and continental cuisine to customers in various cities in different region of country.
The food delivery dataset was taken from Kaggle. The data consists of 145 weeks. Solving this case study will give us an overlook of how real business problems are solved 
using EDA, Statistics and Machine learning.

In this case study we will also develop a basic understanding of how food delivery services can be provided in effective way while handling demand and supply as well as man force on work.
We took sample of 145 weeks and need to predict for next 10 weeks. Through this case study we will learn how to use EDA and Machine learning techniques.

Demand forecasting is a key component to every growing online business Without proper demand forecasting processes in place, it can be nearly impossible to have the right amount of stock on hand at any given time. A food delivery service has to deal with a lot of perishable raw materials which makes it all the more important for such a company to accurately forecast daily and weekly demand.
Too much inventory in the warehouse means more risk of wastage, and not enough could lead to out-of-stocks — and push customers to seek solutions from your competitors. In this challenge, get a taste of demand forecasting challenge using a real dataset. For companies, mainly large ones with economies of scale and geographic capillarity, an error in the forecast of demand can cause several consequences, such as:    
 1. Stock break.
 2.Perishable waste
 3.Drop in production
 4.Pricing errors
